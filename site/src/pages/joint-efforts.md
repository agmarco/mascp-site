## Madison Arcatao Sister City Project

## ANTI-MINING

Mining has devastating effects in Arcatao, El Salvador, Madison and Wisconsin. People from Arcatao, the department of Chalatenango and all over El Salvador have joined together to lobby, demonstrate and educate each other about the devastation and violence that gold mines bring to a community. In Wisconsin we have faced similar issues first with the proposed Crandon Mine and the more recently the proposed Gogebic Taconite iron ore mine. Arcatao and MASCP share strategies and knowledge. Mining activists meet and share experiences. Cross border support and accompaniment thrive as the international anti-mining efforts educate, protest, litigate.

GOGEBIC DROPPING PLANS FOR MASSIVE IRON MINE

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

Gogebic Taconite said Friday afternoon that it was closing its office in Hurley after concluding that the expanse of wetlands at the site made the prospects of constructing a massive iron ore mine unfeasible.

INTERNATIONAL ALLIES AGAINST MINING IN EL SALVADOR

We are a group of organizations from coast to coast in the U.S., Canada and Australia that support the Salvadoran people's demand for sovereignty, the right to water and healthy communities.
