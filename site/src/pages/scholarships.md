## POPULAR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARSHIPS

As US trade, immigration and neo-liberal policies continue to
influence the cost of living and availability of work in El Salvador,
immigration of Salvadorans to the US, Mexico and Canada has

become a critical issue both north and south.


The Popular Human Development Program, administered by the
Catholic Parrish in Arcatao, funds scholarships for university
bound youth in Arcatao and gives seed money to young
entrepreneurs in Arcatao in hopes that this will allow them to not
only stay in their country but also to become future leaders in their
community. MASCP contributes scholarship funds for two
students to attend University in San Salvador for all their years of
study towards a bachelor degree in their chosen fields.

 
At home, MASCP educates people about US trade policies and
cultivates relationships with Wisconsin’s policy makers in
Washington. We meet with them regularly to discuss the
consequences of US foreign policies in Central America and how
our policies can be changed to improve the lives of working
people in El Salvador.
