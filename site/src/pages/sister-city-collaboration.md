## Madison Arcatao Sister City Project

## MADISON SISTER CITY COLLABORATION COMMITTEE

MASCP participates along with the nine other Madison Sister Cities in the Madison Sister City Collaboration Committee.  Madison supports Sister City programs in the belief that they create lasting friendships on the human level and provide a forum for the exchange of important viewpoints and ideas across cultures.

 

The Committee meets monthly and helps organize Madison's annual International Fest. They also offer ways to learn about all of Madison’s different sister city relationships. In 2024, they organized a photo exhibit at Madison’s Downtown Overture Center that highlighted each of the 10 sister cities.
