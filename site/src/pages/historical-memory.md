## PRESERVING THE HISTORICAL MEMORY

# Learn More

It is very important to the people of Arcatao who lived through the war to preserve their memories of the conflict and to record why and how they were fighting for so long and with so many sacrifices. They believe that sharing their history will honor those who committed themselves to liberation and teach future generations how to organize for peace and justice.

MASCP supports special projects to help the people of Arcatao preserve their historical memory. We have provided funds to help create a museum of artifacts and photos from the war and after exhumation of the remains of compatriots buried elsewhere during the war, we bought the land to establish a garden in Arcatao where the remains could be put to rest. Most recently, Molly Todd, an MASCP member and professor at Montana State University embarked on a project to document the history and impact of Sister Cities in El Salvador. Over 30 years of MASCP documents are helping with that effort.

In 1991 a Bangor group undertook a relationship with Carasque, a village in the department of Chalatenango,
El Salvador. At the time, other cities were doing the same, under the auspices of the U.S.- El Salvador Sister City Network. Our intent was to provide accompaniment to people at risk of human rights violations during an armed conflict.
