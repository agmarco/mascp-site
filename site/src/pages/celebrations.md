## 30 YEARS OF SISTERING

## 25 YEARS OF SISTERING

Celebrating 36 Years of Sistering
1986-Present

To celebrate 30 years of sistering, MASCP members participated in an international gathering in Arcatao. This week-long exchange brought together historic solidarity founders as well as people just becoming involved in USESSC. They explored in-depth the issues most affecting Salvadoran people and also learned about the creative strategies that CRIPDES, the largest rural grassroots organization in El Salvador, is implementing to address those issues. Together, generations new and old grappled with strategies to face this changing global context as international allies, and as brothers and sisters.

In 2011 MASCP celebrated 25 years of sistering with Arcatao with a big reunion and party at the Cardinal Bar in Madison. Early founders of MASCP were there; two people from Arcatao obtained visas and came, three Madison mayors attended, representatives from USESSC joined the celebration along with long time friends, supporters and activists. There was a silent auction, refreshments, socializing, remembrances and music provided by Madison’s own Salvadoran band.
