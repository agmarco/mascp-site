Usually the delegations number 8-10 people and can include anyone: families, students, working and older adults, teens, musicians, elected officials, members of the press, etc. They are 7-10 days long and include visiting important historical sites in San Salvador, home stays in Arcatao, outdoor activities, meetings with community groups and lots of visiting and sharing. We also usually visit another community in the USESSC network as well to get a broader understanding of life in El Salvador.All delegations are planned with the help of the USESSC staff in San Salvador. They arrange all the housing and travel arrangements while the group is in-country and help the community members in Arcatao plan for housing and activities while the delegation is there. We always combine activities that are fun with meetings and discussions that help the participants understand some of the challenges that people in El Salvador are facing. Participants do not need to know Spanish. The USESSC staff is bilingual and interprets at all times for the travelers from Madison who do not speak Spanish.All of the MASCP delegations are focused on person-to- person relationships and cross-cultural solidarity. They are carefully planned for sharing information and experiences and for understanding each other’s lives and realities better. Some involve doing a project together that is suggested by community leaders in Arcatao. Some delegations take specific medication and school supplies that the clinic administrator and teachers request. Others share experiences dealing with specific political challenges such as mining, water privatization, immigration, or globalization.MASCP also supports delegates from Arcatao and El Salvador to Madison whenever we can. It is very difficult to obtain the necessary US visas for Salvadoran travelers, much less in a timely manner. This makes planning delegations from Arcatao very challenging, but with the help of USESSC, we do have visits occasionally from our friends in Arcatao friends in Arcatao who already have visas.​If you are interested in joining a delegation to Arcatao, please contact us for more information.Donate NowAre you interested in joining a delegation to Arcatao?We would love to hear from you.
